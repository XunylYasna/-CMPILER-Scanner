## General Instructions

From techniques you have picked up in class, a scanner or lexical analyzer converts a stream of input into a list of tokens. In this problem set, you are tasked to create your own lexical analyzer for recognizing valid tokens, following the lexical rules of MIPS64, a reduced instruction set for CPU.



## Instructions
Navigate to the src folder and include an input file in the directory. Open the command prompt and run the following

```
javac Main.java
java Main (inputFile.txt)
```
